# Movie Gross Revenue Correlation - Python
In this project, I extracted [Movie Industry](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies "Kaggle") data and used Python to find correlations between variables. First, I assumed that the budget of a film would be highly correlated to its gross revenue. The more money a company spends, the greater the likelihood of that film becoming successful and generating a positive return from sales. 

Although these two variables shared the highest correlation compared to other pairs of variables, Votes and Gross Revenue were also highly correlated with one another. This is likely due to critics such as IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes vote on ratings to give film and how those ratings depending on good or bad can leave a beneficial or detrimental effect on gross revenue. 

Overall, I enjoyed the insights obtained in this project and I hope you enjoy viewing the process of how I came to these conclusions below.
