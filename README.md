# Movie Gross Revenue Correlation - Python
In this project, I extracted [Movie Industry](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies "Kaggle") data and used Python to find correlations between variables. My initial prediction was that the budget and gross revenue for a film would together be highly correlated. My reasoning was that if a company is willing to spend a lot of money to produce a high-quality film, then there would be a high chance in the film being successful and generating a lot of gross revenue.
